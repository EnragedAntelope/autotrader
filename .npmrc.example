# Example .npmrc configuration for this project
# Copy this file to .npmrc and customize for your system

# If you have Python 3.13 but need 3.12 for node-gyp:
# 1. Download portable Python 3.12 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
# 2. Extract to a folder (e.g., C:\python312\)
# 3. Uncomment and update the path below:

# python=C:\python312\python.exe

# On Linux/Mac, you might use:
# python=/usr/local/bin/python3.12

# This configuration only affects THIS project, not your system-wide Python.

# NOTE: When running npm run rebuild, you may see deprecation warnings from
# @electron/rebuild's dependencies. These are normal and can be safely ignored.
# We cannot fix them as they are transitive dependencies.
